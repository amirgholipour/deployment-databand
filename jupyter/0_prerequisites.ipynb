    "\n",
    "You will need to execute commands using your terminal and they use the conventions of the [bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). All Linux distributions and MacOS include bash or a compatible command-line interface. On Windows, you can try to setup the [Windows-Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on your computer. If it is not possible to install bash, you will have to figure out an alternative way of issuing the commands you will see during all the modules.\n",

While it is not strictly necessary, you should [install](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) it on your local computer. Otherwise, you will have to copy and paste the bash commands and execute them in a terminal.\n",
