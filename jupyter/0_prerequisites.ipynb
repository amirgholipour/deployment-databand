    "If you want to run all exercises \"live\" and complete this workshop effectively, there are some pieces of software that you will need to install on your computer. Remember that it is not madatory at all, but you will be limited to a normal reading if you decide not to install them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.- `bash`\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to execute commands using your terminal and they use the conventions of the [bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). All Linux distributions and MacOS include bash or a compatible command-line interface. On Windows, you can try to setup the [Windows-Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on your computer. If it is not possible to install bash, you will have to figure out an alternative way of issuing the commands you will see during all the modules.  If you are not familiar with bash, it is recommendable to visit online resources to get a basic knowledege. [Here](https://www.coursera.org/projects/coding-for-beginners-an-easy-introduction) you can see one of the many examples you could find.\n",

    "\n",
    "This workshop has been developed with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) technology in order to maximize the user experience. While it is not strictly necessary, you should [install](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html) it on your local computer. Otherwise, you will have to copy and paste the bash commands and execute them in a terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are parts of the workshop that have been developed with [python](https://www.python.org/) which is a requirement of several technologies we will cover. There is no needed to be a python programmer but a basic knowledge is highly recommendable. Please review the introduction of any tutorial you may find in internet. The course mentioned [above](https://www.coursera.org/projects/coding-for-beginners-an-easy-introduction) may also be a good start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contents of this workshop are placed on a [github repository](https://github.com/angel-ibm/deployment-databand), mirrored in a [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/angel-ibm/deployment-databand). Displaying and reading the web pages online is fine but if you want to work comfortably, it is highly recommendable to [install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) and clone the repository on your local computer. If you are not familiar with [git](https://github.com/git-guides) you should, at least download the repository and open it with jupyter. \n"
